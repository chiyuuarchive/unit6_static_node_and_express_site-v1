# Techdegree-project-6
 Static Node and Express Site

The aim of this project is to showcase some of the techdegree projects that I've worked with at Treehouse Island Inc using using "server-side" Javascript and modules such as "express" and "pug" (formerly known as jade). For the "Exceeds Expectations" grade, a stylesheet "effects.css" has been added to this project to give hover effects to thumbnails and anchor texts in the portfolio. In addition, below are some other customization done to the "styles.css" file:

- Background color of the element "article changed from #fefefe to #ddf2fd. Refer to line 31 in styles.css
- Font color of the sidebar paragraph changed from #999 to rgb(201, 201, 201). Refer to line 170 in styles.css
- Font color of the sidebar anchor element changed from #555 to rbg(88, 103, 109). Refer to line 179 in styles.css
- Sidebar and body background color changed from #0a0a0a to rgb(30, 30, 30). Refer to line 25 and 140 in styles.jss
- Added background color (#f1faff) to navigator, div(with the "box" class) and wrapper element. Refer to line 66, 85 and 111 in styles.jss
